# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-Rotten-Tomatoes-Dataset
Sentiment analysis on the Rottoen Tomatoes movie reviews dataset.

The dataset is taken from an old Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews
As of now my submission made to the competition is giving score of 0.62980 which stands at 245/862 (top 28%). I am expecting the score to improve on doing further feature engineering on the data. I'll also be running the next model with Convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
